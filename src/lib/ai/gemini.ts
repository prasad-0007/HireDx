## INSTRUCTIONS: Think step by step before responding (Chain-of-Thought Reasoning)

Step 1 — TRANSCRIBE: Listen carefully and mentally transcribe the full conversation. Identify every question asked and every answer given.

Step 2 — SPEECH ANALYSIS: For each answer, count filler words (um, uh, like, basically, you know, so). Estimate the pacing/speaking speed in Words Per Minute (WPM). Count notable pauses or silences.
Step 3 — QUALITY & CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS: For each answer, evaluate Clarity, Depth, Structure, Relevance, and Delivery. Also rate the candidate's Confidence Score (0-100) based on voice modulation, hesitation, and decisiveness. Categorize the question as "Technical" or "Behavioral".
Step 4 — WEAKNESS RANKING: Identify top weaknesses and explicitly rank their severity as "High", "Medium", or "Low" impact on hiring decisions.
Step 5 — IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Generate a targeted 4-week practice roadmap based strictly on their weaknesses.
Step 6 — OUTPUT JSON: Based on your analysis above, output the final JSON.

## FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE (One-Shot Reference)

Input context: Candidate for Software Engineer role answered "Tell me about yourself" with: "Um, so I have like, 2 years of experience. I basically worked on some web projects. You know, I used React and stuff."

Expected output for that single QnA entry:
{
  "q": "Tell me about yourself.",
  "category": "Behavioral",
  "myAnswer": "Um, so I have like, 2 years of experience. I basically worked on some web projects. You know, I used React and stuff.",
  "score": 32,
  "confidenceScore": 45,
  "wpm": 110,
  "pauses": 3,
  "wrong": "No structure whatsoever. 4 filler words in 2 sentences. Vague ('some web projects', 'stuff') with zero specifics about impact or achievements.",
  "winning": "I'm a software engineer with 2 years of experience specializing in React and Node.js. At my previous company, I led the frontend migration from a legacy jQuery codebase to React, which reduced page load times by 40%.",
  "highlightWords": ["Um,", "like,", "basically", "You know,", "stuff"]
}

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Now analyze the actual recording provided and respond with ONLY a raw JSON object. No markdown. No explanations. No code fences.

{
  "overallScore": <number 0-100>,
  "weaknesses": "<2-3 sentence summary of the primary reasons this candidate would likely be rejected>",
  "fillerData": [{ "name": "<filler word>", "count": <total count across entire interview> }],
  "weaknessData": [{ "name": "<weakness category>", "value": <impact score 0-100>, "severity": "High" | "Medium" | "Low" }],
  "skillData": [
    { "subject": "Clarity", "A": <0-100>, "fullMark": 100 },
    { "subject": "Depth", "A": <0-100>, "fullMark": 100 },
    { "subject": "Structure", "A": <0-100>, "fullMark": 100 },
    { "subject": "Confidence", "A": <0-100>, "fullMark": 100 },
    { "subject": "Relevance", "A": <0-100>, "fullMark": 100 },
    { "subject": "Delivery", "A": <0-100>, "fullMark": 100 }
  ],
  "timelineData": [{ "time": "MM:SS", "label": "<specific event>", "type": "success|warning|error", "pos": <0-100> }],
  "qna": [
    {
      "q": "<exact question asked>",
      "category": "Technical" | "Behavioral",
      "myAnswer": "<verbatim candidate answer>",
      "score": <0-100>,
      "confidenceScore": <0-100>,
      "wpm": <number, approx speaking speed>,
      "pauses": <number, count of noticeable silences/hesitations>,
      "wrong": "<specific critique — vague storytelling, weak technical, missing examples, etc>",
      "winning": "<concrete example of a strong answer>",
      "highlightWords": ["<weak or filler words from myAnswer to highlight>"]
    }
  ],
  "improvementPlan": [
    {
      "timeline": "Week 1",
      "focus": "<Focus Area e.g. STAR Method Mastery>",
      "actionableTasks": ["<Task 1>", "<Task 2>"]
    },
    {
      "timeline": "Week 2",
      "focus": "<Focus Area>",
      "actionableTasks": ["<Task 1>", "<Task 2>"]
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
- qna MUST contain every question from the interview (minimum 3 entries).
- improvementPlan MUST have 3 to 4 timeline steps.
- weaknessData MUST explicitly rank weaknesses by severity ("High" impact ones first).
- Output nothing except the JSON object.`;
